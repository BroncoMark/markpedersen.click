                <p class="article-text">The Denver Broncos were founded on August 14, 1959, when minor league baseball owner Bob Howsam was awarded an 
                    American Football League (AFL) charter franchise. The Broncos won the first-ever AFL game over the Boston Patriots 13-10, 
                    on September 9, 1960. Seven years later on August 5, 1967, they became the first-ever AFL team to defeat an NFL team, with a 13-7 
                    win over the Detroit Lions in a preseason game. However, the Broncos were not successful in the 1960s, winning more 
                    than five games only once (7-7, 1962), compiling a 39-97-4 (.293) record during the ten seasons of the AFL.
                </p>
                <p class="article-text">Denver came close to losing its franchise in 1965, until a local ownership group took control, and rebuilt the team.
                     The team's first superstar, "Franchise" Floyd Little, was instrumental in keeping the team in Denver, due to his signing in 
                     1967 as well as his Pro Bowl efforts on and off the field. The Broncos were the only original AFL team that never played in 
                     the title game, as well as the only original AFL team never to have a winning season while a member of the AFL during the upstart 
                     league's 10-year history.
                </p>

                <h2 class="article-title">1970-1982</h2>
                <p class="article-text">In 1972, the Broncos hired former Stanford University coach John Ralston as their head coach. In 1973, he 
                  was the UPI's AFC Coach of the Year, after Denver achieved its first winning season at 7-5-2. In five seasons with the Broncos, 
                  Ralston guided the team to winning seasons three times. Though Ralston finished the 1976 season with a 9-5 record, the team, 
                  as was the case in Ralston's previous winning seasons, still missed the playoffs. Following the season, several prominent 
                  players publicly voiced their discontent with Ralston, which soon led to his resignation.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Red Miller, a long-time assistant coach was hired and along with the Orange Crush Defense (a nickname 
                  originated in 1977, also the brand of the popular orange-flavored soft drink) and aging quarterback Craig Morton, took the 
                  Broncos to what was then a record-setting 12-2 regular-season record and their first playoff appearance in 1977, and ultimately 
                  made their first super bowl appearance in Super Bowl XII, in which they were defeated by the Dallas Cowboys (Morton's former team),
                   27-10.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In 1981, Broncos' owner Gerald Phipps, who had purchased the team in May 1961 from the original owner Bob Howsam, 
                  sold the team to Canadian financier Edgar Kaiser Jr., grandson of shipbuilding industrialist Henry J. Kaiser.[17] In 1984, the team 
                  was purchased by Pat Bowlen, who placed team ownership into a family trust sometime before 2004 and remained in day-to-day control 
                  until his battle with Alzheimer's disease forced him to cede the team to Joe Ellis in 2014.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">1983-1998: John Elway era</h2>
                <p class="article-text">Dan Reeves became the youngest head coach in the NFL when he joined the Broncos in 1981 as vice president and head 
                  coach. Quarterback John Elway, who played college football at Stanford, arrived in 1983 via a trade. Originally drafted by the Baltimore 
                  Colts as the first pick of the draft, Elway proclaimed that he would shun football in favor of baseball (he was drafted by the New York 
                  Yankees to play center field and was also a pitching prospect), unless he was traded to a selected list of other teams, which included 
                  the Broncos. Prior to Elway, the Broncos had over 24 different starting quarterbacks in its 23 seasons to that point.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Reeves and Elway guided the Broncos to six post-season appearances, five AFC West divisional titles, three 
                  AFC championships and three Super Bowl appearances (Super Bowl XXI, XXII and XXIV) during their 12-year span together. The Broncos 
                  lost Super Bowl XXI to the New York Giants, 39-20; Super Bowl XXII to the Washington Redskins, 42-10; and Super Bowl XXIV to the San 
                  Francisco 49ers, 55-10; the latter score remains the most lopsided scoring differential in Super Bowl history. The last year of the 
                  Reeves-Elway era were marked by feuding, due to Reeves taking on play-calling duties after ousting Elway's favorite offensive 
                  coordinator Mike Shanahan after the 1991 season, as well as Reeves drafting quarterback Tommy Maddox out of UCLA instead of going 
                  with a wide receiver to help Elway. Reeves was fired after the 1992 season and replaced by his protégé and friend Wade Phillips, who 
                  had been serving as the Broncos' defensive coordinator. Phillips was fired after a mediocre 1994 season, in which management felt he 
                  lost control of the team.</p>
                <p class="article-text">In 1995, Mike Shanahan, who had formerly served under Reeves as the Broncos' offensive coordinator, 
                  returned as head coach. Shanahan drafted rookie running back Terrell Davis. In 1996, the Broncos were the top seed in the AFC with a 13-3
                   record, dominating most of the teams that year. The fifth-seeded Jacksonville Jaguars, however, upset the Broncos 30-27
                    in the divisional round of the playoffs, ending the Broncos' 1996 run.</p>
                <h3>1997-1998: Back-to-back Super Bowl champion</h3>
                <p class="article-text">During the 1997 season, Elway and Davis helped guide the Broncos to their first Super Bowl victory, a 31-24 
                  win over the defending champion Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. Though Elway completed only 13 of 22 passes, throwing one 
                  interception and no touchdowns (he did, however, have a rushing touchdown), Davis rushed for 157 yards and a Super Bowl-record three 
                  touchdowns to earn the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award—this while overcoming a severe migraine headache that caused him blurred 
                  vision. The Broncos repeated as Super Bowl champions the following season, defeating the Atlanta Falcons (led by Elway's longtime 
                  head coach Dan Reeves) in Super Bowl XXXIII, 34-19. Elway was named Super Bowl MVP, completing 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, with an 
                  80-yard touchdown to wide receiver Rod Smith and one interception.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">1999-2011: Post-Elway era</h2>
                <p class="article-text">John Elway retired following the 1998 season, and Brian Griese started at quarterback for the next four seasons. 
                  After a 6-10 record in 1999, mostly due to a season-ending injury to Terrell Davis, the Broncos recovered in 2000, earning a Wild Card 
                  playoff berth, but losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, 
                  former Arizona Cardinals' quarterback Jake Plummer replaced Griese in 2003, and led the Broncos to two straight 10-6 seasons, earning 
                  Wild Card playoff berths both years. However, the Broncos went on the road to face the Indianapolis Colts in back-to-back seasons and 
                  were blown out by more than 20 points in each game, allowing a combined 90 points.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Plummer led the Broncos to a 13-3 record in 2005 and their first AFC West division title since 1998. After a 
                  first-round bye, the Broncos defeated the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, 27-13, denying New England from becoming 
                  the first NFL team ever to win three consecutive Super Bowl championships. They were the first team to beat the Patriots in the playoffs 
                  during the Tom Brady era. The Broncos' playoff run came to an end the next week, after losing at home to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 
                  AFC Championship game, 34-17. The Steelers went on to win Super Bowl XL.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The Broncos' defense began the first five games of the 2006 season allowing only one touchdown - an NFL record that 
                  still stands. ESPN commentator and Super Bowl-winning QB Joe Theismann gave the 2006 defense the name “Bad Blue” on Monday Night Football 
                  as they played the Ravens. However, the team struggled down the season stretch. Plummer led the team to a 7-2 record, only to struggle and 
                  be replaced by rookie quarterback Jay Cutler. Cutler went 2-3 as a starter, and the Broncos finished with a 9-7 record, losing the tiebreaker 
                  to the Kansas City Chiefs for the final playoff spot. Cutler's first full season as a starter in 2007 became the Broncos' first losing 
                  season since 1999, with a 7-9 record.</p>
                <p class="article-text">The 2008 season ended in a 52-21 loss at the San Diego Chargers, giving the Broncos an 8-8 record and their third 
                  straight season out of the playoffs. Mike Shanahan, the longest-tenured and most successful head coach in Broncos' franchise history, 
                  was fired after 14 seasons.</p>
                <p class="article-text">On January 11, 2009, two weeks after Shanahan was fired, the Broncos hired former New England Patriots' offensive 
                  oordinator Josh McDaniels as the team's new head coach. Three months later, the team acquired quarterback Kyle Orton as part of a 
                  trade that sent Jay Cutler to the Chicago Bears.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Under McDaniels and Orton, the Broncos jumped out to a surprising 6-0 start in 2009. However, the team lost eight 
                  of their next ten games, finishing 8-8 for a second consecutive season and missing the playoffs. The next season (2010), the Broncos 
                  set a new franchise record for losses in a single season, with a 4-12 record. McDaniels was fired before the end of the 2010 
                  season following a combination of the team's poor record and the fallout from a highly publicized videotaping scandal. Running backs 
                  coach Eric Studesville was named interim coach for the final four games of the 2010 season. He chose to start rookie first-round 
                  draft choice Tim Tebow at quarterback for the final three games.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Following the 2010 season, Joe Ellis was promoted from Chief Operating Officer to team president, while John 
                  Elway returned to the organization as the team's Executive Vice President of Football Operations. In addition, the Broncos hired 
                  John Fox as the team's 14th head coach. Fox previously served as the Carolina Panthers' head coach from 2002 to 2010.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Following a 1-4 start to the 2011 season, Tim Tebow replaced Kyle Orton as the Broncos' starting quarterback, 
                  and “Tebow Time” was born. Tebow led the Broncos with toughness, determination and miraculous come-from-behind victories which 
                  gave the Broncos hope and were the catalyst for better things to come. Tebow led the Broncos to an 8-8 record and garnered 
                  the team's first playoff berth and division title since 2005. The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card 
                  round on a memorable 80-yard touchdown pass from Tebow to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on the first play of overtime, 
                  setting a record for the fastest overtime in NFL history. However, the Broncos lost to the New England Patriots in the 
                  Divisional round.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">2012-2015: Peyton Manning & the No Fly Zone era</h2>
                <p class="article-text">In March 2012, the Broncos reached an agreement on a five-year, $96 million contract with former longtime 
                  Indianapolis Colts' quarterback Peyton Manning, who had recently missed the entire 2011 season following multiple neck surgeries. 
                  This resulted in the Broncos subsequently trading incumbent quarterback Tim Tebow to the New York Jets.[37] The Broncos finished 
                  with a 13-3 record and the AFC's No. 1 seed in the 2012 playoffs, but were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional round.</p>
                <p class="article-text">iLike in 2012, the 2013 Broncos finished with a 13-3 record and the AFC's No. 1 seed. The Broncos broke all 
                  offensive records and QB Peyton Manning shattered many QB records that season as well. In the 2013 playoffs, they defeated the 
                  San Diego Chargers in the Divisional round and the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. However, the Broncos lost to t
                  he Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII by a score of 43-8, the Broncos' first Super Bowl berth since winning back-to-back Super 
                  Bowls in 1997 and 1998.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Prior to the start of the 2014 season, the Broncos announced that Pat Bowlen, the team's owner since 1984, 
                  relinquished control of the team due to his battle with Alzheimer's disease, resulting in team president Joe Ellis and general manager 
                  John Elway assuming control of the team.[20] The Broncos finished the 2014 season with a 12-4 record and the AFC's No. 2 seed. 
                  However, the Broncos were defeated by the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional round of the 2014 playoffs, marking the third time 
                  in four seasons that the Broncos lost in the Divisional round of the playoffs. Quarterback Peyton Manning had been playing with 
                  strained quadriceps for the final month of the 2014 season.</p>
                <h3>2015: Super Bowl 50 champions; Manning's final season</h3>
                <p class="article-text">On January 12, 2015, one day after the divisional playoff loss to the Colts, the Broncos and head coach John Fox 
                  mutually agreed to part ways. Fox left the Broncos with a .719 winning percentage in his four seasons as the Broncos' head 
                  coach—the highest in franchise history. One week later, the Broncos hired Gary Kubiak as the team's 15th head coach. Kubiak 
                  served as a backup quarterback to executive vice president/general manager John Elway from 1983 to 1991, as well as the Broncos' 
                  offensive coordinator from 1995 to 2005. Shortly after Kubiak became head coach, the Broncos underwent numerous changes to their 
                  coaching staff and players, including the hiring of defensive coordinator, defensive mastermind Wade Phillips, under whom the Broncos' 
                  defense went from middle of the road to being ranked No. 1 in the NFL. By the 2015 season, it would go on to be considered one of the 
                  greatest NFL defenses of all time - along with the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2002 Buccaneers. The Broncos finished with a 12-4 
                  record and the AFC's No. 1 seed, despite Peyton Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis 
                  Colts in 1998. Backup quarterback Brock Osweiler started the last six games of the regular season due to Manning suffering from a foot 
                  injury. Manning led the Broncos throughout the playoffs. The Broncos defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 23-16 in the Divisional Round 
                  and the New England Patriots 20-18 in the AFC Championship. They were victorious against the Carolina Panthers 24-10 in Super Bowl 50 
                  for their third Super Bowl title.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">2016-Present: The Quarterback Carousel era</h2>
                <p class="article-text">On March 7, 2016, quarterback Peyton Manning retired after 18 NFL seasons during a press conference at the team's 
                  Dove Valley headquarters. Following Manning's retirement, the Broncos scrambled to find the team's next starting quarterback after backup 
                  quarterback Brock Osweiler departed on a four-year contract to the Houston Texans. The Broncos acquired Mark Sanchez from the Philadelphia 
                  Eagles and selected Paxton Lynch during the 2016 draft. Sanchez, Lynch and second-year quarterback Trevor Siemian competed for the 
                  starting quarterback spot during the off-season and preseason. Prior to the regular season, Sanchez was released and Siemian was named the 
                  starter. The Broncos finished the season 9-7 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010.</p>
                <p class="article-text">On January 2, 2017, coach Gary Kubiak announced his retirement, citing health as the main reason for retiring. The 
                  Broncos hired Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Vance Joseph as head coach on January 11, 2017. The Broncos finished 5-11 in 2017 as a 
                  result of an unimpressive offense led by a quarterback committee of Trevor Siemian, Brock Osweiler, and Paxton Lynch. In an effort to address 
                  poor production from the offense, the Broncos signed quarterback Case Keenum on March 14, 2018, and traded away Trevor Siemian to the 
                  Minnesota Vikings on March 19, 2018. On May 1, 2018, the Broncos signed local undrafted free agent running back Phillip Lindsay, who became 
                  a fan favorite due to his underdog mentality, explosive play style and local roots. Lindsay became the first undrafted player in NFL history 
                  with 100+ scrimmage yards in each of their first two games and on December 18, 2018, Lindsay was voted to the 2019 Pro Bowl, making 
                  him the first undrafted offensive rookie in NFL history to be voted to a Pro Bowl. After getting off to a strong start, their 2018 season 
                  was up and down, eventually finishing with a 6-10 record and placing third in the AFC West. Coupled with the 5-11 season in 2017, the 
                  Broncos had back-to-back losing seasons for the first time since 1971-1972. Shortly after the conclusion of the regular season, 
                  head coach Vance Joseph was fired after recording a poor 11-21 record in two seasons.</p>
                <p class="article-text">On January 10, 2019, the Broncos hired Chicago Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio to become the 17th head coach 
                  in franchise history. Fangio was chosen over Mike Munchak, the Broncos' offensive line coach. Fangio received a four-year contract with a 
                  team option for an additional season. On February 13, 2019, Joe Flacco was announced as the new starting quarterback. On October 6, 2019, 
                  the Broncos defeated the Los Angeles Chargers for their 500th win, bringing their win-loss record to 500-432. On December 1, 2019, the 
                  Broncos started Mizzou rookie quarterback Drew Lock for the first time. He would lead the Broncos to a 4-1 record to end the 2019 NFL 
                  season. The Broncos went on to finish 2nd place in the AFC West Division at 7-9, missing the playoffs for a fourth consecutive year. 
                  In five games, Lock finished with 1,020 passing yards, seven touchdowns, and three interceptions.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 NFL season did not have a preseason or full training camps, which likely 
                  contributed to an abnormally large amount of injuries that plagued the Broncos and other NFL teams. Star linebacker Von Miller suffered 
                  a season-ending ankle tendon injury before the regular season started, and starting wide receiver Courtland Sutton suffered as
                  eason-ending torn ACL during a week two game. On November 29, 2020, after all three of the Broncos' quarterbacks were placed in 
                  COVID-19 protocol, the Broncos were forced to turn to undrafted wide receiver and former college quarterback Kendall Hinton as the 
                  emergency quarterback. Hinton completed only one pass for 13 yards in 9 attempts—the fewest pass completions in a single game in franchise 
                  history, and was intercepted twice. The Broncos' only scoring play was a 58-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus in a 31-3 loss 
                  to the New Orleans Saints. In July 2021, the Pro Football Hall of Fame announced that Hinton's quarterback wristband would be added to the 
                  Hall of Fame as part of a display. The Broncos finished the season with a record of 5-11, last in the AFC West, and missed the playoffs 
                  for the fifth consecutive year.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Following another season of uninspiring quarterback performances, the Broncos were the subject of multiple quarterback 
                  trade rumors during the 2021 offseason. Aaron Rodgers and Deshaun Watson were two names rumored to be of interest for the Broncos, but 
                  ultimately the Broncos traded for quarterback Teddy Bridgewater on April 28, 2021. A subsequent quarterback competition between Bridgewater 
                  and Drew Lock would occur during the preseason, which Bridgewater won and was named the Broncos' starting quarterback on August 25, 2021. 
                  The Broncos also made notable improvements in the defensive secondary, signing former All-Pro cornerback Kyle Fuller and cornerback Ronald 
                  Darby, as well as drafting Alabama cornerback Patrick Surtain II with the ninth overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. Running back Phillip 
                  Lindsay was replaced by UNC rookie running back Javonte Williams, who was drafted in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft by the Broncos.
                  On October 31, 2021, Peyton Manning (who won two AFC Championships, Super Bowl 50, and an NFL MVP during his four seasons as a Bronco) 
                  was inducted to the Broncos' Ring of Fame during a game against Washington. On November 1, 2021, the Broncos traded franchise legend 
                  Von Miller to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for a 2nd and 3rd round pick in the 2022 NFL Draft. At the time of the trade, Miller 
                  was the longest-tenured Bronco on the team, and the only remaining non-special teams player from Denver's Super Bowl 50 roster.</p>
